# ObjectSelect
Project done using Unity Engine
-in this small project, it explores the idea of selecting objects
-the selection occurs with the left mouse button, by either single click or dragguing a selection box
-selected objects turn into a different color when selected
-pressing the left mouse button in another location that is not an object will de-select all previuos selections
-by right clicking on any part of the map will make all selected objects move into the position
-unselect objects will ignore any right click
